# Download the XSL models

[XSL webpage](http://xsl.u-strasbg.fr/page_ssp_all.html)

See Verro et al. (2022b) for the details of stellar population modelling.
To start using the XSL models in PST, users simply need to download the desired model stored in the tarballs listed on the official site and extract its contents.
If using the default PST ssp path, the data needs to be located within a directory named `XSL`.
