# Download the E-MILES models

[EMILES webpage](http://research.iac.es/proyecto/miles/pages/spectral-energy-distributions-seds/e-miles.php)

To start using the EMILES models in PST, users simply need to download the desired model, e.g. the SSP models created with the BASTI isochrones and Kroupa 2001 IMF correspond to the file `EMILES_BASTI_BASE_KU_FITS.tar`.
If using the default PST ssp path, the data needs to be located within a directory named `EMILES`.
