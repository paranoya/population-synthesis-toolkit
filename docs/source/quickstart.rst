Quickstart Guide
==================

This guide demonstrates how to quickly get started with PST by combining the spectra of several Simple Stellar Populations (SSPs) and calculating their photometric properties.

Minimal Working Example
========================
In this example, we'll load a **Single Stellar Population (SSP)** model using the **PopStar** library, calculate photometry for multiple SSPs, and plot the **g - r color** as a function of stellar age and metallicity.

Step-by-Step Breakdown
======================
1. **Import the necessary modules**: Start by importing the `PopStar` model for SSPs, a function to load photometric filters, and standard libraries like `numpy` and `matplotlib` for calculations and plotting.

2. **Define the Initial Mass Function (IMF) and redshift**: We'll use the **Chabrier IMF** (2003), which is commonly used in stellar population studies, and set the redshift to `0.0`, representing local observations.

3. **Load photometric filters**: Photometric filters allow you to calculate synthetic magnitudes from the SSP spectra. Here, we load the `g` and `r` filters from the SDSS system.

4. **Initialize the SSP model**: We'll create a `PopStar` instance, passing in the IMF as a parameter.

5. **Compute the photometry**: We calculate the photometric flux for each SSP in the selected filters and convert the results to **AB magnitudes**.

6. **Calculate the color (g - r)**: This is a simple subtraction of magnitudes in the `g` and `r` bands.

7. **Visualize the results**: Finally, we plot the `g - r` color as a function of SSP age and metallicity.

Code Example
============
Hereâ€™s the complete code for this workflow:

.. code-block:: python

    from pst.SSP import PopStar
    from pst.observables import load_photometric_filters
    import numpy as np

    # Define the IMF and redshift
    imf_type = 'cha'  # Chabrier 2003 Initial Mass Function
    z_redshift = 0.0  # Redshift at which the SSPs are observed
    
    # Load photometric filters (g and r bands)
    list_of_filter_names = ["SLOAN_SDSS.g", "SLOAN_SDSS.r"]
    filters = load_photometric_filters(list_of_filter_names)
    
    # Initialize the SSP model
    ssp_model = PopStar(IMF=imf_type)

    # Compute photometry for the SSPs in the selected filters
    photometry_fluxes = ssp_model.compute_photometry(filter_list=filters,
                                                     z_obs=z_redshift)

    # Convert fluxes to AB magnitudes
    magnitudes = -2.5 * np.log10(photometry_fluxes.to_value("3631 Jy / Msun"))

    # Compute g - r color
    color = magnitudes[0] - magnitudes[1]

    # Plot the color as a function of stellar age and metallicity
    import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
    plt.figure()
    plt.pcolormesh(np.log10(ssp_model.ages.value),
                   np.log10(ssp_model.metallicities), color,
                   cmap='jet')
    plt.colorbar(label=r'$g - r$')
    plt.xlabel('log(Age / yr)')
    plt.ylabel('log(Z / Z_sun)')
    plt.title(r'$g - r$ Color as a Function of Age and Metallicity')
    plt.show()
