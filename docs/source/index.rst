Welcome to PST's Documentation
==========================================

Overview
========
MySPS is a Python package for Stellar Population Synthesis (SPS), designed for astronomers and astrophysicists. It provides tools to model and analyze the integrated light from galaxies, star clusters, and stellar populations.

Key Features
=============
- Model **Single Stellar Populations (SSP)** or **Composite Stellar Populations (CSP)**.
- Input **Star Formation Histories (SFH)** and calculate spectra, photometry, or integrated properties.
- Flexible **Initial Mass Function (IMF)** options, including user-defined IMFs.
- Output synthetic **spectral energy distributions (SEDs)** and broad-band photometry.
- Fit observed data to estimate parameters like age, metallicity, and dust content.
