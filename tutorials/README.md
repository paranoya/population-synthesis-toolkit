# PST tutorials

In this directory you can find some pratical tutorials to get you up to speed!

- In SIMPLE_STELLAR_POP users can get a first glimpse of creating and manipulating an `SSP` model.

- Several examples on how to build a `ChemicalEvolutionModel` can be found in the `models` directory. 
    - Analytical expression for the Mass/Star Formation History and the Chemical Enrichemt History.
    - The Chemical Evolution Model `TabularCEM` is meant to build models from tabulated data.
    - Chemical Evolution Model from a set of individual simple stellar populations (referred to as "particles") using `ParticleListCEM`.

- Finally, a tutorial showing how to generate a grid of photometric fluxes from a given model, including the effects of redshift, and dust attenuation.
